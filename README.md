# HVAC-Calculator

As a environmental engineer I figured I'd create a online calculator that helps with the tedious portion of creating an HVAC project. 
This particular app alows it's users to calculate the pipe/air duct diameters and sizes in 4 different specializations 
(Heating, Ventilation, Water supply and gas supply). The techstack used to build this app: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
